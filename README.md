# 🍙 Hyprland Dotfiles

Just in case my laptop blow up — here’s the backup.  
Don’t blame me if your laptop also blow up 🔥💻  
Also, don’t expect any auto-install magic here ✨ (you’re on your own).

## ⚡ Base
These dotfiles are based on [JaKooLit/Fedora-Hyprland](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Fedora-Hyprland).  
Why? Because building Hyprland from scratch is *painful* 🥲.

- If your rice looks weird — that’s your problem.
